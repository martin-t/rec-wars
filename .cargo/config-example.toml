# This is from https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/.cargo/config_fast_builds but modified.
# Explanation: https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/ - CTRL+F Enable Fast Compiles (Optional)
# To get faster compile times, rename this to config.toml and rust-toolchain-example.toml to rust-toolchain.toml
# You can use symlinks to get potential future updates - run these in project root:
#   ln -s rust-toolchain-example.toml rust-toolchain.toml
#   cd .cargo
#   ln -s config-example.toml config.toml

# panic = "abort" disables unwind tables so backtraces are almost completely useless,
# if a panic happens inside library code, we don't even get names of our functions.
# To fix that, we use -Cforce-unwind-tables=y in .cargo/config.toml.
# https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81902

# NOTE: For maximum performance, you need a nightly compiler
# If you are using rust stable, remove the "-Zshare-generics=y" below.

# NOTE: you must manually install https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld on mac. you can easily do this with the "brew" package manager:
# `brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld`

# Optional: bevy suggests reducing debug to 1 (line number tables), matklad / rust-analyzer suggests 0.
# In most cases the gains are negligible, but if you are on macos and have slow compile times you should see significant gains.
# Seems to have no effect for me on linux.
