      # Actions-rs/install is unmaintained but works for now.
      # Alternatives for when it breaks:
      #  - dtolnay/install - not a full replacement - only supports crates he uses (not audit currently)
      #  - baptiste0928/cargo-install - looks like it just compiles the crate and then caches it for subsequent runs
      #  - just `cargo install` and caching it
